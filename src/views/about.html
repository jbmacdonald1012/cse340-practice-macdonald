        <p>I'm Jason Macdonald, I'm a senior in my last semester studying Software Engineering.  I live in Ammon Idaho next to Idaho Falls with my wife of 11 years and our 4 kids Logan, Chloe, Isabella and Charlotte. I currently work as a Full Stack Software Engineer, although I have more of a drive for backend development than I do for the front-end, but I enjoy what I do in Web Automation.</p>
    
        <p>I love spending time with my family. Right now, my kids are HUGE fans of playing Minecraft, so I enjoy playing with them in local private worlds and seeing all the cool things we can build together.</p>
